# Scite4AutoIt-Themes

## Intro

These themes are an attempt to copy the themes that comes with Scite4AutoIt. Being that there are many further customizations available for VS Code compared to Scite, many colorations in VS Code may not match, and these may not be as well combined as they are in Scite, as VS Code colorizes things slightly different from Scite in some instances.
Because of the vast number of available settings and tokens for each language, it has been thought best to only have these custom themes apply to AutoIt files. I have used the token names from the two leading AutoIt extensions that are currently available, published by LoganCH and Genius257.   When the user opens any other language file, the theme coloring will revert to the base theme's colorization for tokens, but not for the editor colors.
The base VS Code themes are all MIT licensed, and belong to the respective owners. All Scite Themes are owned by the developers of Scite4AutoIt, and I claim no ownership to any of them.
